### KLaTsL

**KLaTsL** is a programming language for linear algebra. The syntax is similar to that of its parent language, OCaml (with which its interpreter is built). In this, I explore liquid typing and the idea of a dimensional type system, thereby integrating linear algebra rules into typechecking. KLaTsL introduces functionality including bringing the function-based list comprehension functionality to vectors and matrices and functions and types based on coordinate systems. 

The intent of the language is to render highly mathematical operations as more mundane operators and in a simple computational model In a sense, it's comparable to Numpy or Matlab, but aims to develop a purely functional representation.
