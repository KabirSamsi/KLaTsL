### KLaTsL

**KLaTsL** is a purely functional programming language for linear algebra. The syntax is similar to that of its parent language, OCaml (with which its interpreter is built). But a range of new functionality is introduced, including bringing the function-based list comprehension functionality to vectors and matrices, introducing matrix factorizations as operators, and functions and types based on coordinate systems.

The intent of the language is to render highly mathematical operations as more mundane operators and in a simple
computational model In a sense, it's comparable to Numpy or Matlab, but aims to develop a purely functional representation.

Stay posted as I eventually post a demo discussing the semantics and implementation of the language!
